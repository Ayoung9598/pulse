At a high level, an NFR should include: 
-  Scalability: How can the application scale as workloads fluctuate? (For example, scale from 1,000 transactions per second to 10,000 transactions per second in a given day or month.) 
-  Availability and reliability: What is the acceptable downtime for system availability? (For example, 99.99% availability or 45 minutes' downtime per month.) 
-  Performance: What is the performance requirement? Where can the system handle the load increase without impacting the end user experience? (For example, the catalog page needs to load within 3 seconds.) 
-  Portability: Can the application run on multiple platforms without any additional work? (For example, the mobile app needs to run in the iOS and Android operating systems.) â€¢ Capacity: What is the maximum workload that the application can handle? (For example, the maximum number of users, the number of requests, the expected response time, and the expected application load.)
