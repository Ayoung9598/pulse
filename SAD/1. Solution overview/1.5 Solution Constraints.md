Typical barriers you hear from analytics teams
 - Limited insight into customer experiences and operations
 - Need to make quicker decisions: This is a two-part problem: 
	 1. Traditional data systems are being overwhelmed, resulting in existing workloads taking a long time to complete. 
	 2. More decisions need to be made in seconds or minutes, requiring systems to collect and process data in real time.
 - Enabling innovation with machine learning
 - Technical staff and cost to scale self-managed infrastructures
