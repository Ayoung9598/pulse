### DevOps
In a DevOps (short for development and operations) approach, the development team and the operations team work collaboratively during the build and deployment phases of the software development life cycle, sharing responsibilities, and providing continuous feedback. The software builds are tested frequently throughout the build phase on production-like environments, allowing early detection of defects

### Configuration management
Configuration management (CM) is the process of using automation to standardize resource configurations across your entire infrastructure and applications. CM tools such as Chef, Puppet, and Ansible can help you manage IaC and automate most system administration tasks, including provisioning, configuring, and managing IT resources.

## Introducing DevSecOps

DevSecOps is about the automation of security and the implementation of security at scale.
DevSecOps is not there to audit code or CI/CD artifacts. Organizations should implement DevSecOps to enable speed and agility, but not at the expense of validating security.
A DevSecOps approach results in built-in security and is not applied as an afterthought. DevOps is about adding efficiency to speed up the product launch life cycle, while DevSecOps validates all building blocks without slowing the life cycle.

## Combining DevSecOps and CI/CD

A DevSecOps practice needs to be embedded with every step of the CI/CD pipeline. DevSecOps ensures the security of the CI/CD pipeline by managing the right access and roles assigned to each server and making sure the build servers such as Jenkins are hardened to be protected from any security glitch.

To identify security vulnerabilities at various stages, you can integrate multiple tools into DevSecOps pipelines and aggregate the vulnerability findings. Application security testing (AST) using tools that automate the testing, analysis, and reporting of security vulnerabilities is essential for application development.

AST can be broken down into the following:
 - Software composite analysis (SCA): SCA evaluates the open-source software's security, license compliance, and code quality in a codebase. SCA attempts to detect publicly disclosed vulnerabilities contained within a project's dependencies. Popular SCA tools are OWASP Dependency-Check, Synopsys' Black Duck, WhiteSource, Synk, and GitLab. 
 -  Static application security testing (SAST): SAST scans an application before the code is compiled. SAST tools give developers real-time feedback as they code, helping them fix issues before passing the code build phase. It is a white-box testing methodology that analyzes source code to find security vulnerabilities that make your applications susceptible to attack. The best thing about SAST is that it can be introduced very early on in the DevOps cycle, during coding, as it does not require a working application and can take place without code being executed. Popular SAST tools are SonarQube, PHPStan, Coverity, Synk, Appknox, Klocwork, CodeScan, and Checkmarx. 
 -  Dynamic application security testing (DAST): DAST looks for security vulnerabilities by simulating external attacks on an application while the application is running. It attempts to penetrate an application from the outside by checking its exposed interfaces for vulnerabilities and flawsâ€” this type of black-box security testing is also known as a web application vulnerability scanner. Popular DAST tools are OWASP ZAP, Netsparker, Detectify Deep Scan, StackHawk, Appknox, HCL AppScan, GitLab, and Checkmarx. 
 -  Interactive application security testing (IAST): IAST analyzes code for security vulnerabilities while the app is run by an automated test or activity validating application functionality. IAST tools report vulnerabilities in real time and do not add extra time to your CI/CD pipeline. IAST tools are deployed in a QA environment to implement automated functional tests. Popular IAST tools are GitLab, Veracode, CxSAST, Burp Suite, Acunetix, Netsparker, InsightAppSec, and HCL AppScan


### Implementing a CD strategy

Some of the most popular techniques to implement through CD are as follows:
 -  In-place deployment: Update application in a current server 
 -  Rolling deployment: Gradually roll out the new version in the existing fleet of servers 
 -  Blue-green deployment: Gradually replace the existing server with the new server 
 -  Red-black deployment: Instant cutover to the new server from the existing server 
 -  Immutable deployment: Stand up a new set of servers altogether

### Implementing continuous testing in the CI/CD pipeline

DevOps is key for the continually changing business scenarios based on customer feedback, demand for new features, or shifts in market trends
A general rule of thumb is to incorporate 70% of your testing efforts in unit testing.
It is also recommended to run static code analysis on the code changes and do code coverage, adherence to coding guidelines, and so on.

## A/B testing

Often, in software development, it isn't clear which implementation of a feature will be most successful in the real world.
A/B testing is a testing methodology in which two or more different versions of features are given to different sets of users.

### Source code management

You can set up, run, and manage your Git server, where you will be responsible for everything.
You can choose to use a hosting service such as GitHub or Bitbucket. If you are looking for a cloud solution, then AWS CodeCommit offers a secure, highly scalable, and managed source control system where you can host private Git repositories.


### Continuous integration server
A CI server is also known as a build server. With teams working on multiple branches, it gets complicated to merge back into the main branch.

### Code deployment
-  OneAtATime: Only a single instance in a deployment group at a time installs a new deployment. Suppose a deployment on a given instance fails. In that case, the deployment script will halt the deployment and return an error response detailing the number of successful versus the number of failed installations. 
-  HalfAtATime: Half of the instances in the deployment group install a new deployment. The deployment succeeds if half of the instances successfully install the revision. HalfAtATime can again be a good option for production/ test environments where half of the instances are updated to a new revision, and the other half remain available in production at an older revision.
- AllAtOnce: Each instance installs the latest revision available whenever it next polls the deployment service. This option is best used for development and test deployments as it has the potential to install a non-functioning deployment on every instance in a deployment group. 
-  Custom: You can use this command to create a custom deployment configuration specifying a fixed number of healthy hosts that must exist in a deployment group at any given time. This option is a more flexible implementation of the OneAtATime option. It allows for the possibility that a deployment may fail on one or two instances that have become corrupt or are improperly configured.

### Code pipeline
The code pipeline is about orchestrating everything together to achieve CD. The entire software release process is fully automated in CD, including build and deployment to the production release.

The code pipeline enables you to add actions to stages in your CI/CD pipeline. Each action can be associated with a provider that executes the action. The code pipeline action's categories and examples of providers are as follows: 
-  Source: Your application code needs to be stored in a central repository with version control called source code repositories. Some of the popular code repositories are AWS CodeCommit, Bitbucket, GitHub, Concurrent Versions System (CVS), Subversion (SVN), and so on.
-  Build: The build tool pulls code from the source code repository and creates an application binary package. Some of the popular build tools are AWS CodeBuild, Jenkins, Solano CI, and so on. Once the build is completed, you can store binaries in an artifactory such as JFrog. 
-  Deploy: The deployment tool helps you to deploy application binaries on the server. Some popular deployment tools are AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS CodeDeploy, Chef, Puppet, Jenkins, and so on
-  Test: Automated testing tools help you to complete and perform post-deployment validation. Some popular test validating tools are Jenkins, BlazeMeter, Ghost Inspector, and so on. 
-  Invoke: You can use an events-based script to invoke activities such as backup and alert. Any scripting language such as a shell script, PowerShell, and Python can be used to invoke various customized activities. 
-  Approval: Approval is an essential step in CD. You can either ask for manual approval by an automated email trigger or approval can be automated from tools.

## Implementing DevOps best practices

While building a CI/CD pipeline, consider your need to create a project and add team members to it. The project dashboard provides visibility to the code flow through the deployment pipeline, monitoring the build, triggering alerts, and tracking application activities.

Consider the following points while designing the pipeline: 
-  The number of stages: Stages could be development, integration, system, user acceptance, and production. Some organizations also include dev, alpha, beta, and release stages. 
-  Types of tests in each stage: Each stage can have multiple types of tests such as unit tests, integration tests, system tests, UATs, smoke tests, load tests, and A/B tests at the production stage. 
-  The sequence of a test: Test cases can be run in parallel or need to be in sequence. 
- Monitoring and reporting: Monitor system defects and failures and send notifications as failures occur. 
-  Infrastructure provisioning: Methods to provision infrastructure for each stage. 
-  Rollback: Define the rollback strategy to fall back to the previous version if required.
