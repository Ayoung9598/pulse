### Implementing authentication and authorization control
The purpose of authentication is to determine if a user can access the system with the provided credentials of user ID and password, while authorization determines what a user can do once they are inside the system.

For authorization, you should start with the principle of least privilege—it means users should not have any access to begin with, and are assigned only the required access types according to their job role.

Enabling single sign-on (SSO) with a centralized users repository helps to reduce the hassle of remembering multiple passwords for your user base and eliminates any risk of password leakage.

Large organizations use centralized user management tools such as Active Directory (AD) for employee authentication and authorization, to provide them access to internal enterprise applications such as the HR system, the expense system, the timesheet application, and so on.

### Applying security everywhere
Apply the defense-in-depth (DiD) approach, and put security at various layers of the application; for example, a web application needs to be secured from external internet traffic by protecting the Enhanced Data rates for Global Evolution (EDGE) network and Domain Name System (DNS) routing. Apply security at the load balancer and network layers to block any malicious traffic.

### Reducing the blast radius
While applying security measures at every layer, you should always keep your system isolated in a small pocket to reduce the blast radius. If attackers get access to one part of the system, you should be able to limit a security breach to the smallest possible area of the application.

### User identity and access management

### Federated identity management and single sign-on
FIM (Federated identity management) provides a way to connect the identity management system when user information is stored in the third-party identity provider (IdP).

SSO allows the use of a single sign-on, with which the user can access multiple services.

### Kerberos
Kerberos is an authentication protocol that allows two systems to identify each other in a secure way and helps to implement SSO.

Kerberos has a Key Distribution Center (KDC), which facilitates authentication between two systems. The KDC consists of two logical parts—the Authentication Server (AS) and the Ticket-Granting Server (TGS).

### Amazon Web Services Directory Service
Amazon Web Services (AWS) Directory Service helps to connect AWS resources in your account with an existing on-premises user management tool such as AD. It helps to set up a new user management directory in the AWS cloud. AWS Directory Service facilitates a secure connection to the on-premises directory. After establishing the connection, all users can access cloud resources and on-premises applications with their already existing credentials.

AWS AD Connector is another service that helps you to connect the existing Microsoft AD to the AWS cloud. You don't need any specific directory synchronization tool. After setting up an AD connection, users can utilize their existing credentials to log on to AWS applications. Admin users can manage AWS resources, using AWS IAM.

### Microsoft Active Directory(EntrantID)
AD (Active Directory) is an identity service developed by Microsoft for users and machines. AD has a domain controller, also known as Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), which stores the user's and the system's information, their access credentials, and their identity.

### OAuth and OpenID Connect

OAuth is an open standard authorization protocol that provides secure access to an application. OAuth provides secure access delegation. OAuth doesn't share password data but uses the authorization token to establish the identity between service providers and consumers.

### DDoS mitigation
Resilient architecture can help to prevent or mitigate DDoS attacks. A fundamental principle in keeping your infrastructure secure is reducing the potential number of targets that an attacker can hit
